## Programming Language

A programming language is a formal language (or artificial language, that is, a language with well-defined grammatical rules) that gives a person, in this case the programmer, the ability to write (or program) a series of instructions or sequences of commands in the form of algorithms, in order to control the physical or logical behavior of a computer, so that various kinds of data can be obtained or specific tasks can be executed. This entire set of commands written using a programming language is called a program.

## Types of Programming Languages

Programming languages can be classified according to how they are used by the machine or operating system:

**Interpreted:** the instructions are translated one by one by an application (interpreter). Examples: Python, Perl, Bash.

**Compiled:** the instructions are translated as a group by an application (compiler). Examples: Fortran, C/C++.

**Intermediate:** Partly compiled, partly interpreted. Examples: Java, Scala.

## What is a Python program?

A Python program is a set of instructions written in this language that tells the computer what to do.

These instructions can perform tasks such as calculating, storing data, displaying messages, or making decisions.

**In other words:**

A program is a sequence of steps that solve a problem or perform a specific action.

## What are variables in Python?

A variable is a space in memory where data (such as a number, text, or Boolean value) is stored for later use in the program.

* They are given a name.

* Their value can change during program execution.

**Example:**

**This is a small Python program**

*We define variables*

name = "Emilse"

age = 37

city = "Arboletes"

*We display the information on the screen*

print("Hello,", name)

print("You are", age, "years")

print("You live in", city)

**Explanation of the example:**

name, age, and city are variables.

Each one stores a different value: text or a number.

print() is used to display the data on the screen.

The entire code block is a Python program.

## Personal Reflection
I learned to create my first website using GitHub Pages.

This tool allows me to showcase my projects and learning online.

Furthermore, practicing with Python examples reinforces my knowledge of logic and problem-solving.
